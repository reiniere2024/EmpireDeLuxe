Hi All,

World Empires is a small Game that I made to try to restore the gaming fun
from old strategic games like Empire the Luxe.

The object of the game is to obtain world dominance and the game can be played
with a friend or against the computer. The rules are simple and all parameters
of the game can be changed in the setup.

When you open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 then don't forget to move the "map",
"unit" directories and countries.xml to the bin/debug directory when you want to 
run the code.

Good luck,
Reiniere.
